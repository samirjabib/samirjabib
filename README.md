<h1 align="start">React + Node.js Developer | Shopify Specialist</h1>

Developer specialized in **React** and **Node.js** with +5 years of experience building modern web applications, **SaaS products**, **digital products**, and high-performance **e-commerce solutions** — including custom headless storefronts with **Shopify Hydrogen** 

I build clean, scalable, and maintainable applications using **React** on the frontend (with TypeScript, modern patterns, and performance focus) and **Node.js** on the backend (from simple APIs with Express to structured, enterprise-ready applications with NestJS).

Since late 2022, I’ve been heavily using **generative AI** (starting with ChatGPT beta → now Cursor, Claude, and frontier models) — always with **full human supervision and review** — which allows me to produce significantly more high-quality code in less time while maintaining consistency and best practices.

Passionate about creating fast, reliable, and developer-friendly systems using React + Node.js ecosystems, modern TypeScript architectures, and the latest headless commerce tools.
